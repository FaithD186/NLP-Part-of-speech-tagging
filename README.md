# Hidden_Markov_Model_POS_tagger

Create a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech(POS) tagging, including training probability tables (i.e., initial, transition and emission) for HMM from training files containing text-tag pairs, and performing inference with the trained HMM to predict appropriate POS tags for untagged text.
