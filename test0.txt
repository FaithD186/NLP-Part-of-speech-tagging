Detective
Chief
Inspector
John
McLeish
gazed
doubtfully
at
the
plate
before
him
.
Having
thought
he
was
hungry
,
he
now
realized
that
actually
he
needed
anything
rather
than
the
overflowing
plate
of
cholesterol
the
canteen
at
New
Scotland
Yard
had
provided
with
such
admirable
promptness
.
Mark
picked
up
another
car
at
the
London
plant
and
drove
up
the
M1
to
his
home
in
north
Buckinghamshire
.
